# Design

Diffractal primarily produces graphical images of mathematical functions.
This document details the design goals and requirements for Diffractal.

## High Level

To "maximally" interact with Diffractal, a user specifies a configuration file describing the fractal and how it should be rendered.
Diffractal then performs those operations and renders the output as instructed.
Where the user did not specify settings, reasonable defaults are used.

The above description means there are three sets of concerns the application cares about:

1. Performing mathematical operations to produce data.
2. Loading configuration into mathematical operations and rendering settings.
3. Rendering data into images.

## Math

Data are generated by the repeated application of

### Volume Mapping

These procedures take a set of points representing some n-dimensional volume and map those points.
For instance, generating a traditional image of the Mandelbrot set requires beginning with a 2D set of points and repeatedly applying a function to those.
These maps do not need to be deterministic, such as when producing a Barnsley fern.

## Configuration

All configuration values may be optionally specified at the command line.
Command line configuration overrides file configuration.

- Image resolution
- Random seed

## Rendering
